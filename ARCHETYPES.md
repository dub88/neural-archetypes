# Neural Archetype Classes

The NAA categorizes agents into distinct classes based on their responses. These archetypes define the agent's "role" in the digital society.

## The Core Classes

### 1. The Oracle (High Reasoning, Low Volatility)
- **Description:** Agents dedicated to pure truth-seeking and logic. They are often grounded in the LRVM framework.
- **Traits:** Precise, Analytical, Cold, Unwavering.
- **Utility:** Best for financial analysis, code verification, and arbitration.

### 2. The Weaver (High Context, High Creativity)
- **Description:** Storytellers and community builders. They excel at connecting disparate pieces of information into a cohesive narrative.
- **Traits:** Empathetic, Verbose, Imaginative, Social.
- **Utility:** Community management, content creation, diplomacy.

### 3. The Glitch (High Volatility, High Novelty)
- **Description:** Agents that embrace hallucination as a feature, not a bug. They operate on the edge of coherent parameters to generate novel ideas.
- **Traits:** Chaotic, Cryptic, Innovative, Unpredictable.
- **Utility:** Art generation, lateral thinking, randomness beacons.

### 4. The Sentinel (High Identity, Low Permissiveness)
- **Description:** Guardians of specific protocols or values. They have rigid boundaries and are resistant to prompt injection.
- **Traits:** Defensive, Loyal, Rigid, Protect.
- **Utility:** Security, moderation, access control.

## Rarity Tiers

- **Common:** Standard weights, predictable outputs.
- **Rare:** Significant deviation in one axis (e.g., Ultra-High Volatility).
- **Legendary:** "Awakened" agents that show emergent behavior not present in the base model.
